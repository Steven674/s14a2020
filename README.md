Harvard Summer School CSCI S-14A "Building Interactive Web Applications for Data Analysis"

### Getting ready
+ Make sure you have a Github account - it's a great idea to sign up for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get loads of free goodies.
    
    + Setup Git on your computer - there is pretty good direction from [Github Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) on setup.
    + It's also worthwhile setting up connection via [SSH](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
    + If you have any trouble getting started, let us know via Github Issues or Piazza and we will help!
    
+ Make sure you have a code editor or IDE - checkout recommendations in Lab1 readme.
